# yua-clock
A clock with [Yua Kusunoki](https://scienceadventure.wiki.gg/wiki/Kusunoki_Yua) on it. Slightly altered from the tweet I showed it in, this is just the clock part of the program. I made Yua Utilities as an ffmpeg wrapper and just added the clock part into it.

## Downloading
If you are a normal person and just want to use the app go to Releases and click "1.0.0.0" and download Yua.Clock.exe

## Building
Uses .Net Framework 4.7.2. You just open the .sln in Visual Studio and build the project.
